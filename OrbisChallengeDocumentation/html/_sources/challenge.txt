The Challenge
=============

Here is where you can find information on how to do well in the Challenge. 

Every submission will play at least 6 games against different opponents.

.. _submissions:

Submissions
-----------

Follow the following steps when you are ready to submit your submission. 

1. Make sure all your source code and external libraries are in the tronplayer and lib directories respectively.

2. Compress tronplayer and the lib directory into an archive and name it after your team name. 

.. Note::
	* We only accept .zip files that are under 5 MB in size. 
	* The libraries that came in the dev kits will be replaced when grading, so feel free to exclude them when creating your archive.
	* Feel free to exclude the lib directory entirely if you did not use any external libraries.  

3. Upload your newly created archives at the event/submit page on The Challenge website.

.. Note::	
	You're welcome to submit more than once, only your latest submission before the submission deadline will be graded.

.. _grading:

Grading Scheme
--------------

Each submission is graded as follows: 

.. math::

	outcome\_score + bonus\_scores

Scores are calculated at the end of the game, and logged in an XML file when the match is completed. Scores are **not** kept during the game.

Outcome score
`````````````

The :math:`outcome\_score` of a game differs depending on whether you won, lost or tied the game. Points are awarded as follows: 

===== ====
Win   1000
Tie   300
Loss  0
===== ====

Bonus score
```````````

Bonus points are awarded by based on your interactions with power ups and time survived. 

Time is measured as the number of tiles travelled by your light cycle. You are rewarded 1 point per square traversed.

Powerup bonuses are awarded as follows: 

50 points per powerup collected and 200 bonus points per Bonus Points powerup collected.


Competition Format
--------------------

Grading is split into two parts. First is the preliminaries, in which your submission will play against 3 different opponents which we will be providing. The top 15 from the preliminaries will move to the second round, where they'll be playing against everyone else in the top 15. 

Settings
````````

All games will be played on the following settings: 

	* Minimum board size of 13, maximum board size of 31
	* Max amount of time waiting for responses = 100 milliseconds
	* Server and clients will all be running on the same machine.

Preliminaries
`````````````

First your submission will play against 3 opponents of various difficulties.

First up is a 2-round match against **the Born Loser**. As its name suggests, this AI is very easily killed.

Second up is a 3-round match against **the Rookie**. It's a bit smarter than the Born Loser, but it won't be putting much of a fight.

Finally, you play a 2-round match against **the Contender**. This will demarcate the truly strong entries.


Round Robin Finals
`````````

Suppose your submission made it to the top 15. Congratulations! There are 14 other player here with you, so it's time to battle it out. You'll be playing a 3-round match against each opponent, it's time to show them who's the boss!

Presentations
`````````````

Not only do you have to code well, you should also be able to communicate your ideas fluently too. The teams that have their submissions land in the top 5 after the playoffs are asked to give a short presentation and talk about the problems they've faced, and how they've overcame them.
